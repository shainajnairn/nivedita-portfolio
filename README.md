# Nivedita Shainaj Nair's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio, showcasing my work as a Robotics Software Engineer specializing in autonomous mobile systems, SLAM, and sensor fusion.

## About Me
I’m Nivedita Shainaj Nair, a Robotics Software Engineer with a Master’s in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Automation Engineering from Northeastern University (May 2025) and a Bachelor’s in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology (2023). I’m passionate about building efficient solutions for autonomous navigation using C++, Python, ROS, and advanced techniques like SLAM, VIO, and trajectory optimization. I’m seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative robotics and software engineering projects.
